In App.java, the findNumberOfSearchedElementInTheSameIndex method takes two arraylists and an integer element as parameters. Returns the number of integer elements given as parameters in the same indexes of two arraylists. 
App.java is tested in AppTest.java. First, the case where two arrays are null and then one array is null is tested.In other tests, tests are made by knowing how many times the element is found. In the last test, it is checked if the integer element is null.
New Feature.
